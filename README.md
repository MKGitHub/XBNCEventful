Library for sending &amp; receiving events much like notifications but only in your app for event-based architecture.


Introduction

• Open source, you can see whats going on behind the scenes and contribute.
• Distributed, low-coupling characteristics, benefit from greater circulation.

• Guaranteed to send & receive events.
• Avoid all the mysteries of notifications and the notification center.
• Build your apps using event-based architecture.
• Easily scalable architecture.
• Get rid of boilerplate, glue-code and spaghetti-code.

Requirements
Both the Mac OS X and iOS demo projects are set to their somewhat "high" deployment target to avoid annoying build warnings, e.g. interface builder, auto layout, asset catalog, icons, images etc.
Essentially the XBNCEventful library works on:
• Mac OS X (10.6 and later).
• iOS (4.0 and later).

Usage
• Try the Mac OS X and iOS demo project.
• Try the test cases.
